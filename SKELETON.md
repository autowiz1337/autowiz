Validation Rules
Required Fields by Section:
Section 1: year, make, model, mileage, price, exteriorColor, interiorColor
Section 2: tier, primaryAppeal, standoutExterior, standoutInterior
Section 3: name, city, knownFor, setsApart
Section 4: None (all optional)

When "No special offer" checked, specialOffer field is disabled/hidden
Price must be positive number
Year must be 1900-2026
Mileage must be positive number
Styling Guidelines
Use card-based design with shadows
Active section has blue border-left accent
Completed sections have green checkmark
Buttons: Primary (blue), Secondary (gray), Success (green)
Smooth transitions for all state changes
Mobile responsive (stack sections vertically)
Use Tailwind's form styling utilities
Spacing: generous padding/margins for breathing room
Quality Score Calculation Function
javascript
const calculateQualityScore = (formData) => {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Required fields (40%)
  const requiredComplete = /* check all required fields */;
  if (requiredComplete) score += 40;
  
  // Standout features (15%)
  if (formData.condition.standoutExterior && 
      formData.condition.standoutInterior) score += 15;
  
  // Premium features (15%)
  const totalFeatures = Object.values(formData.actionDrivers.premiumFeatures)
    .flat().length;
  if (totalFeatures >= 5) score += 15;
  
  // Wow factor (10%)
  if (formData.actionDrivers.wowFactor) score += 10;
  
  // Urgency triggers (10%)
  if (formData.actionDrivers.urgencyTriggers.length > 0) score += 10;
  
  // Special offer (10%)
  if (formData.actionDrivers.specialOffer || 
      formData.actionDrivers.noSpecialOffer) score += 10;
  
  return Math.min(score, 100);
};
Example Chips Component Pattern
javascript
const ExampleChip = ({ text, onClick }) => (
  <button
    onClick={() => onClick(text)}
    className="px-3 py-1 bg-blue-50 hover:bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 
               rounded-full text-sm border border-blue-200 transition"
  >
    {text}
  </button>
);
Final Notes
Make the form feel fast and responsive
Use optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
Include helpful microcopy throughout
Add empty states for sections
Consider accessibility (aria-labels, keyboard navigation)
Test mobile experience thoroughly
Ensure smooth animations don't cause jank
Generate a complete, production-ready React component that implements all these features. The component should be self-contained and ready to use in a Next.js or Create React App project.
